Dr. Albert G. Prinn is a researcher at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg in Erlangen, Germany. His research focuses on computational acoustics and room acoustics, with particular emphasis on numerical methods for sound field simulation, low-frequency room acoustics, and the estimation of acoustic material properties. He is also a Lecturer at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, where he teaches a master's level course on Virtual Acoustics and supervises student research projects.

Dr. Prinn received his Doctor of Engineering degree in Computational Acoustics from the University of Southampton, where he developed efficient high-order finite element methods for aeroacoustic simulations and contributed novel modeling approaches for aircraft engine noise prediction. Prior to his current roles, he held research and engineering positions at Fraunhofer IIS, Siemens Industry Software, and the University of Southampton, working on both academic and industrial acoustic modeling problems. He has authored numerous journal and conference publications in leading acoustics venues, and actively contributes to the international acoustics research community.
