Virtual Acoustics

Master’s level · 2.5 ECTS

This course introduces the theoretical foundations and practical methods used to simulate sound fields for virtual and augmented reality applications. It provides an integrated perspective on physical acoustics, signal processing, and auditory perception, with an emphasis on their role in the design of virtual acoustics systems.

The course covers sound propagation in enclosed spaces, room impulse responses, spatial audio rendering, and sound localization. Simulation techniques ranging from geometric acoustics to wave-based and hybrid methods are discussed, including their accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to real-time systems. Perceptual aspects such as binaural hearing, head-related transfer functions, and spatial hearing cues are addressed to connect physical modeling with human auditory perception.

The course is aimed at master’s-level students and researchers with a background in acoustics, signal processing, or related fields, and provides a foundation for understanding and developing virtual acoustics solutions for immersive audio, VR/AR, and interactive media.
